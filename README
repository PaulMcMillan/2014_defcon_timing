Content, tools, and resources related to my 2014 Defcon 22 talk
related to timing attacks.

Nanosecond hardware-provided timestamps from tcpdump require libpcap
1.5.3 or better, and a tcpdump build of 4.6rc1 or better.

Interesting bits in this giant pile of mess:

hue/calculate_guess.py
hue/capture.sh
hue/collect_data.py
hue/reset_users.py


Come talk to me. I'll help you get it running. I want someone else to
reproduce this!
