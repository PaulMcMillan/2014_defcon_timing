Philips Hue

Running FreeRTOS/6.0.5

Does eventually choose a link-local address

Janky network stack
- ethernet frame check sequence incorrect occasionally

Spurious traffic:
SSDP (every 50.5 seconds)
ARP for 208.67.222.222 (opendns) every 31 seconds
DHCP discover (after LL assigned, every 60 seconds)

HTTP support notes:
Doesn't support Keep-Alive
Doesn't support HEAD
1 second tcp timeout

Really dumb SSDP implementation. Ignores MX parameter, always responds
to any query.
